I'm currently a research scientist at OpenAI working on AI safety. I recently graduated with my PhD from UC Berkeley, advised by [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and [Shankar Sastry](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sastry.html). My dissertation on "Exploration and Safety in Deep Reinforcment Learning" is available [here](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2021/EECS-2021-34.pdf). I've mostly worked on safe exploration in deep RL, but I'm interested in a wide range of topics, including alignment, optimization, ethics, and systems safety. I did my undergraduate studies at University of Florida (go Gators!), where I earned Bachelor of Science degrees in Physics and Aerospace Engineering.

My goals are to ensure that the long-term future of humanity is good and that faster-than-light space travel becomes real.

Other things: I like reading and writing science fiction and fantasy. I know more about Stargate SG1 than is really reasonable for someone to know. Pacific Rim is the greatest movie of all time.
