# Stuff I Like


## Fiction

* Most stories on [qntm](https://qntm.org/), especially the free webnovels [Fine Structure](https://qntm.org/structure) and [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra). I have a printed copy of the last paragraph of Fine Structure hanging up above my desk.
* [Mono no Aware](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/mono-no-aware/) by Ken Liu, a haunting and stunningly beautiful science fiction short story that I cannot more emphatically recommend.
* [The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction](https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/). You should get a subscription: getting an issue in the mail is such an old-school treat.

## Music

* [Lord Grenville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-Fc6O7L5Uc) by Al Stewart.
* [Vincent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHnRfhDmrk) by Don McLean.
* [Intergalactic Radio Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx3FPiHqG8U) by Vangelis.

## Etc.
